                Keresverse is an open world game containing for example a first person shooter game that will put players into two teams to compete against each other.
                The objective of that FPS game will be to eliminate the rest of the enemy teamâ€™s players in order to achieve victory and take home the prize in the form of blockchain assets in the Play to Earn model.
